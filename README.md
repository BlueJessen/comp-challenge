### Introduction
Practice of building out a comp to spec.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS

### Set Up
1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/BlueJessen/static-comp-mod2).
2. `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `open index.html`.

### Deployment Link
- Page is linked [here](https://bluejessen.github.io/static-comp-mod2/)

### Reflections
- While working with the Static comp I quickly realized how extensive the comp I was building out was. With so many sections I had to build out getting all the moving pieces in place took more time than expected.
- Svg's while very useful have a lot of different ways you can edit them, and how they are connected to your html/css changes how you can edit them.
- A full page has a lot of CSS styling in it and makes me appreciate those I see day to day.
